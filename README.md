# Weather API

06 API weather application to show current conditions, five-day forecast, previous cities searched.

## My Thoughts

While I am improving at thinking like a programmer, I was happy that I got the APIS up and running on my own. The UV piece was tricky as I went and looked for other APIS. I figured out the work-around with the lat/lon feature though and it works well. 

Every condition has been met.
